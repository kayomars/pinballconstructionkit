# Flingball - A Pinball Construction Kit

Flingball is a Java based pinball construction kit that allows multiple users to play pinball over a network, connected with each other through a server.

Each player has their own pinball board, but balls can leave one player’s board and enter another player’s board, running on a different computer. Each board layout is also configurable by file.
