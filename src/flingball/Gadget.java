/**
 * An immutable data type representing a gadget. 
 * Every gadget has an (x,y) location, where x and y are integers in [0,19].
 * Every gadget has a width and height, also integers in [0,19]. 
 * Some gadgets have a fixed width and height (like bumpers), 
 * and others have a configurable width and height (like absorbers).
 * Some gadgets have a coefficient of reflection, which is a multiplier applied 
 * to the magnitude of the ballâ€™s velocity after it bounces off the gadget. 
 * Some gadgets have an orientation (clockwise), 
 * which determines how the gadget is rotated from its default orientation.
 * Each gadget may have a trigger and an action.
 * A trigger is an event that happens at the gadget, such as a ball colliding with it. 
 * An action is a response that a gadget can make to a trigger happening somewhere on the board.
 * Actions and triggers are mediated by the trigger handler.
